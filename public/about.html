<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Thanos — 29 years old and co-owner of Sips + Sins, a small, 
  dive-style bar in Larissa with a strong focus on craft cocktails and 
  hip-hop vibes.</p>
<p>I truly love what I do, but I’ve reached a point where I feel the 
  need for a fresh start. As much as I enjoy being behind the bar,
   I can’t picture myself doing it forever. Maybe it’s the long hours, 
   maybe it’s the hunger for a new challenge — probably both.</p>

<p>At the same time, I’m looking to create an additional source of income. 
  Back in school, web development always fascinated me. 
  I took some classes, got hooked, and always kept it in the back of my mind</p> 

In my free time, I’m often reading — mostly history books, but also mystery stories. I love training my mind like this: traveling to different eras, solving puzzles, and keeping my brain sharp.</p>
